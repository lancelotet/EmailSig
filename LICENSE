### ✅ Notes

- **README links** to `docs/index.html` for the demo.  
- **Screenshot** lives in `/docs` → same path locally and on GitHub.  
- Fully **self-contained**, so GitHub Pages will display `/docs/index.html` correctly.  
- Professional, clean, and easy to navigate.

If you want, I can also **make a tiny “final polish” version of `/docs/index.html`** with matching styles and nav buttons that match this README wording perfectly.  

Do you want me to do that?
